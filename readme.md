# Stories behind these codes
- I wrote these code when I was a freshman and sophomore in the uni during 2014-2016.
- I started to code in 2014 September, the first year of my bachelor degree.
- My major is Software Engineering. The reason that I chose it only because my math is good, 
also my elder sister told me that knowing code helps to get higher salary when you get a job (I don't know how she knew it, I was just impressed and kept that in mind).
- In China, the first programming language to learn is c, different with Australia(Python).
- I knew nothing about the idea of programming when I first studied c in semester one, that frastrated me a lot, I got a relatively low score for c mid semester exam, I was so disappointed in myself.
- After the great failure for me in exam, I started to study very hard. Stayed up late each day to do the PAT (Programming Ability Test). Some of the codes here were written during that time. 
- I achieved very high score in the c final exam that makes me feel confident about myself again, that success had profound significance to me.
- Now I wanna say, choosing software engineering as major is one of the most correct decisions I ever made.
